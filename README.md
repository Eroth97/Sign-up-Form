# Sign-up-Form
This is the OTP project of a sign up form. This project was really interesting because I had to review some CSS advance concepts that I had already forgotten. However the hardest part was writing the js script. This script makes possible password confirmation using just vanilla JS. Even though it has just 9 lines, the idea behind it was not, by any means, trivial to think. 

## What I learned
1. CSS styling of sign up forms.
2. Basic validation of sign up forms.
3. New ways to move my elements of my web page using vanilla CSS. 
4. Advance CSS selectors.
